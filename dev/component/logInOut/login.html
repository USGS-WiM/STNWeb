        The USGS Short-Term Network (STN) is a national-scale application and database designed to support USGS event-based sensor deployments and High-Water Mark (HWM)
        data collection efforts. The STN database is designed to encourage, but not require, repeated visits to temporary sensor deployment (wave or water level) or
        HWM locations. By developing a system that encourages repeated, as-needed deployments in the same locations, it facilitates the development of longer-term datasets
        of storm events than would be feasible by relying on field personnel's memories of previous deployments or interpretations of paper records alone. Such efficient
        responses have become a cornerstone of the USGS Hazards Response.
